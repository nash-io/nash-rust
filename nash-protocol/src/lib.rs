//! Library that handles request construction and cryptography for interacting with Nash exchange.
//! High level behaviors are exposed via the `NashProtocol` and `NashProtocolSubscription` traits.
//! For an example of how to use this library to construct network requests, see an [example client](https://github.com/nash-io/nash-rust/tree/master/nash-native-client)

// FIXME: not all of these should be exposed
